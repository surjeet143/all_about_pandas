Among the deserts, the walnut tart was superb, but i didn't like the peanut-butter mousse at all.\n\nBut, in spite of all that, the reason for the 5-star rating is the service we got. We were served by Mr.Nanda, who made us feel absolutely special. He didn't have to. We were a small party of just two people, we weren't ordering off the main menu, and the restaurant discourages tips. In spite of all that, he was extremely attentive (without being intrusive), engaging and helpful.

Normally, this restaurant is not crowded and I have seen only Arab students in this restaurant.\n\nService (4.5/5)\nThe waiters and captain are very courteous, very helpful, and are eager to serve you. The restaurant area being a small place helps in getting a great service.\n\nComing to food (4/5). I find the food very authentic. Like traditional Iranian cuisine - the food is primarily centered around meat and kababs. Food is non-spicy and yet quite flavorful.\n\nOverall, this is a good place to go for a change or if you are looking for a good Persian/Arab food.'), ('Rated 5.0', 'RATED\n  i liked it because i regularly go the one in church street & they have maintained the same taste in both branches.....for my review you may check the church street review whihc i posted')]",[],Delivery,Banashankari
